phpsets
=======

This is an implementation of mathematical sets in PHP. The class was built to
function in a manner similar to Python's "set" object; the method names are
identical in most cases with underscore-based names being substituted for
camel-case ones, and like the Python implementation of sets, all of the methods
that accept sets also accept arrays or any other object that implements the
Iterator interface.
